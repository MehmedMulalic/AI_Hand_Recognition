# AI Hand Recognition
Project for hand gesture recognition using a neural network from the 'nnfs' (Neural Networks from Scratch) library. The project was made without using any AI-focused libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch; it used the custom AI classes from the 'nnfs' book.
Made by Faris Ćutuk, Mehmed Mulalić and Nedim Kunovac.
The model was zipped because the file was larger than the acceptible upload limit. It has to be unzipped and named 'hand_gesture_model.model'.
