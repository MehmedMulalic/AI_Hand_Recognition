# Gesture_AI_Project
Project for hand gesture recognition using a neural network made from scratch.
Made by Faris Ćutuk, Mehmed Mulalić and Nedim Kunovac.
The model was zipped because the file was larger than the acceptible upload limit. It has to be unzipped and named 'hand_gesture_model.model'.


Dataset gathered from kaggle:
